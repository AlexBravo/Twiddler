# Twiddler keymap for Twidor.jar typing tutor 
# Modified by Alex Bravo, changes are marked with #AB:
#  3/21/2014 Changed to match most keys, but not capital pairs
#  10/5/2014 Made changes for BSS layout, mostly fixed MMCs

# The three top buttons map to the most frequently used keys.  Note
# that in sane command line environments (those that support
# completions), tab is used nearly as much as backspace and both are
# often used many times per line (so we make them more convenient than
# a carriage return).

# Next are the nine most common letters, which can each be produced
# with a single keypress.  They are carefully arranged so that the
# most common combinations of them can be pressed simultaneously to
# produce double letters.  In each case the double letter combinations
# output their two constituent letters in the most common order
# (though with some such as er-re it was a close call).  The doubles
# can be expected to account for roughly one-third of the adjacent
# letter pairs in normal English text!
